# Howdy

I'm William. I've been coding since I was 13. I started with visual basic and have been learning multiple other languages since then.

A few things about me
- I'm self learning in coding, enginnering, networking, sound design, music production, video editing, and photography.
- All my code is free for you to use in your own projects. It's optional to credit me, but it would be nice.
- Some things might break. I also take a bit longer than most people to finish a project because a get distracted easily.

If you need me, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomaswill1yt), [Discord](https://discord.com/users/199264117238923264), or [thomaswill1.com](https://www.thomaswill1.com)

Some languages I know
- Javascript
- C/C#/C++
- Java
- Visual Basic
- And future ones I may learn.

I currently **don't** do paid work. I'm focusing on my own projects. Please **do not ask** if I can program for you. The answer is already no.
